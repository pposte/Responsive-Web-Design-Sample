# Web-Design
Do the following -
1.       Fork code
2.       Make the page responsive
a.       Small mobile (320px)  large desktop
3.       Make the first H1 tag to be fixed at the top of the window so it always shows when you scroll down
4.       Make the “Back to top” link scroll to the top of the “Back to Most Important Story” module and not to the top of the page.
5.       Add a function so when a “Less Important Story” module is clicked it disappears and shows another new version of the module, only 3 “Less Important Story” modules should appear to the user at once.
6.       All appearance/functionality should match across IE11/Chrome/Firefox
You’re welcome to change any markup, CSS and add JS as needed – in addition you’re welcome to add a jQuery reference and use that library.
